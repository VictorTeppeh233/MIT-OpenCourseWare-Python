# Write a program that: 
# * Asks the user for a verb.
# * Prints "I can _ better than you" where you replace _ with the verb.
# * Then prints the verb 5 times in a row separated by spaces.
# For example, if the user enters run, you print:
#     I can run better than you!
#     run run run run run

# your code here

verb = input("type the verb: ")
print("I can", verb, "better than you")
print((verb + " ")* 5)
